        <h1>Animal Care Society</h1>
        <h2>Louisville's First No-Kill Shelter</h2>

        Founded in 1984, ACS is a 501(c)(3) non-profit No Kill adoption agency for dogs and cats.  Weâ€™re a privately funded, volunteer driven organization whose financial support comes solely through annual subscription memberships, donations, and adoption fees. We receive no federal, state, or local government funding.

        We speak for the voiceless and lead by example in our ongoing work. We provide responsible and humane treatment to our dog and cat guests until we can find them appropriate homes.
        
        Over the last ten years, we have placed over 8,000 pets into devoted and responsible homes.  We are proud of our success and our sustained positive impact on our community.
